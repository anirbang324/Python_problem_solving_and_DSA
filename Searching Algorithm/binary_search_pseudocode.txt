1. create function with two parameters which are a sorted array and a value.
2. create two pointers : a left pointer at the start of the array and a right pointer at the end of the array.
3. based on the left and right pointer, calculate the middle pointer:
    - while middle is not equal to the value and start <= end continue the loop:
        a. if middle is greater than the value move the right pointer down.
        b. if middle is greater than the value move the left pointer up.
4. If the value is never found, return -1.
